### 👋 Hi, I’m Mahlatse Seloane

I’m a Software Engineer with 2+ years of experience building modular, performance-conscious systems across real-time and simulation-style applications using C++, Java, and C#.

I hold a Bachelor of Engineering Science in Digital Arts from the University of the Witwatersrand, with a strong foundation in object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, and clean software architecture.

My work focuses on designing well-structured, maintainable systems — emphasizing separation of concerns, disciplined workflows, and long-term clarity. Many of the projects in this repository are simulation engines, game logic systems, and AI-driven frameworks built with professional engineering principles rather than quick prototypes.

Several projects began during my university studies and are now being revisited with a more professional mindset and refactored to reflect industry-aligned practices, including modular architecture, defensive programming, separation of concerns, and clean commit history

This GitHub serves as an active engineering portfolio showcasing:

* System design and modular architectures
* Real-time and simulation-based software systems
* AI behavior frameworks and rule-based engines
* Professional development workflows and refactoring practices

My goal is to continue growing as a reliable, thoughtful software engineer who builds clear, scalable systems and contributes effectively within collaborative development environments.
